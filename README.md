# Analyze International Debt Statistics

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes international debt statistics using SQL. The analysis is aimed at understanding the debt landscape of various countries by querying relevant data and generating insights.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook `notebook.ipynb` contains SQL queries that are executed on a dataset of international debt statistics. The analysis is structured to answer several key questions about global debt, including:

- **Total debt owed by countries:** A comprehensive analysis of the total debt amounts owed by different countries.
- **Debt distribution:** Insights into the distribution of debt across countries and regions, identifying those with the highest and lowest debt levels.
- **Debt by income groups:** Examination of debt statistics by different income groups, such as low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries.
- **Specific categories of debt:** Analysis of specific debt categories, such as public and publicly guaranteed debt, private debt, etc.

## Dataset

The data used in this notebook is sourced from an international debt statistics database. The dataset includes information on the debt amounts owed by countries across various categories and income groups. It is assumed that the dataset is available in the environment where the notebook is executed.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook successfully, the following tools and libraries are required:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
- **SQLAlchemy** (or any other SQL interface for Python)

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

  ```bash
